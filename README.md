# Populating a Simulation using Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithm used to populate a world simulation. The world would include animals of all kinds (carnivores, hervibores and
scarvengers), illnesses, weather conditions, and seasons. 

During the development of this program (intended to be turned in as an assignment), the main difficulty would lie on finding a
set of parameters that would make the simulation stable enough for it to last around 15 seconds with almost all species alive.

To solve this, I developed a genetic algorithm in order to find the best combination of parameters in order to make it last the
longest.
